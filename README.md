<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

Taste of the World Café (TWC) is a three-month-old, family-owned restaurant offering dishes inspired by American, Italian, Mexican, and Asian cuisines. The business currently offers 32 menu items. Over the first three months of trading, management observed that the broad menu is negatively affecting profitability, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

This analysis used sales and menu data from Maven Analytics (orders_details and menu_items) to identify low-performing items by units sold and gross profit contribution. Based on the analysis, the following 10 items are recommended for removal from the menu: Chicken Tacos; Potstickers; Chips & Guacamole; Hot Dog; Cheese Quesadillas; Steak Tacos; Chips & Salsa; Fettuccine Alfredo; Salmon Roll; Meat Lasagna.

Removing these items is expected to: reduce inventory and storage costs; simplify kitchen operations and reduce preparation time variability; lower food waste; and improve overall profitability and customer service speed.
